# This is a Collection of AI Projects and Implementation of various Machine Learning Algorithms Tutorials

This project is an ongoing growing compilation of all the types of AI machine learning algorithms and different tutorial's implementations examples I have come across. This compilation contains my understanting of the topics and may differ from the actual implementations done in the tutorials. This compilation is targeted more toward creating a single compilation of what I learn about the topic, the related resources and a point of references for future. I share it with hopes the compilation will help someone who needed some structured reference on the topic.  

All project codes are written in independent Jupyter Notebooks and categorized according to the type of Machine Learning algorithm that is implemented. The categorization is acheaved via folders and sub-folders.  

    NOTE: This collection of project is only directed to ML projects and not Deep Learning projects. I felt even though Deep Learning while being a ML/AI subset has its own vast categories and implementations, so I decided to make a seperate repository dedicated for Deep Learning. Stay Tuned for updates of that repository ....

## Environment Setup:
- Install conda (my version: miniconda 24.7.1) for maintaining seperate environment
- VS code for editing code.
- VS code Jupiter Notebook Extension for viewing the Jupyter Notebooks implementations

## Setup env:
- Create a new conda env with Python version 3.11.11 from the Jupiter Notebook as it will setup a .conda folder locally that will be automatically loaded onto the notebook and terminal for the project by VS code (one I used during development)

    Alternatively you can utilize Google Collab or any other cloud Jupiter Notebook services to run the example projects with the setup already done. Make sure you be aware of which code block is being executed as project specific conda package installation commands are written in Notebook files.
